# PyChat

## Introduction
PyChat is an online chat program made in Python (who'da thunk).
You can download it and use it as a foundation for your own chat programs!

## Setup
1. Set ```HOST``` in both Server.py and Client.py to a public IP address (*LocalHost works if you just want to test it out*)
2. Run Server.py on the ```HOST``` device (*if Server.py is not running, no user will be able to use PyChat, duh*)
3. Run Client.py on any client device (*a window asking for the client's username should show up*)
4. Enter any username (*literally, any username; there's no identification for the user lol*)
5. Repeat steps three and four (*this creates another user*)
6. Start chatting! (*there's no moderation!*)

*You can use [**pyinstaller**](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/?adlt=strict&redig=015340A9572A4814855724C9985239F0&toWww=1) for converting your PyChat ```Client.py``` file to an ```.exe``` file, but I haven't tested this.*

***PyChat is still in a very early development stage. It's not totally clear what I want to do with it for now.***
