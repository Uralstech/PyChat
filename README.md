# PyChat

## Introduction
PyChat is an online chat program made in Python (who'da thunk).
You can download it and use it as a foundation for your own chat programs!

## Setup
1. Run Server.py (*set ```HOST``` to LocalHost if you just want to test it out*)
2. Set ```HOST``` in Client.py to the IP address printed on-screen by Server.py
3. Run Client.py on any client device (*a window asking for the client's username should show up*)
4. Enter a username
5. Enter a password
6. Repeat steps three to five (*this creates another user*)
7. Start chatting! (*there's no moderation!*)

*You can use [**pyinstaller**](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/?adlt=strict&redig=015340A9572A4814855724C9985239F0&toWww=1) for converting your PyChat ```Client.py``` file to an ```.exe``` file, just remember to set the ```HOST``` IP.*
